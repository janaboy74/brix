- I have originally developed this algorith for the Amiga(m68k assembly) for audio recording. It could record the last few seconds of samples, until the mouse button was pressed. I lost the code so I needed to rewrite it in c++.
- It has several use cases like: debug logs, catching only the last few records of data for various purposes.
- It has a small memory and cpu footprint, so it can be used on week / old devices.
